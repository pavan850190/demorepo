#  C Programming on Multiple platforms - PBL Approach
## features
- To view the balance
- To withdraw balance
- To deposit balance

## State of art/ Research
Now a days the people are not intrested in wasting time and due to covid they are not intrested to go to bank for money in thise case we use atm these atm Automated teller machines (ATMs) have altered the relationship between banks and their depositors, as well as the competitive relationships among banks. Which help the people to get money instant in there locality.If an error occurs, the ATM will automatically shutdown and return the card to the user.A main menu will be output to the display after validation of the PIN. The User selects Withdraw from the menu and withdraws cash from the ATM. The User selects Deposit option from the menu and deposits cash or cheques into the ATM. 
1. Account balance checking
2. ATM Cash withdrawal
3. Deposition of cash
## 4 W's and 1H
### Who
People to who need monwy
### When
when the people required money and save time.
### What
Verifying the the account details and add/subtract money.
### Where
Around many places in town.
### How
Geting money after inserting atm card and entering pin.

## High Level Requirements
1. A customer must be able to make a cash withdrawal from any suitable account linked to the card, in multiples of 100.
2.  A customer must be able to make a deposit to any account linked to the card, consisting of cash and/or checks in an envelope. The customer will enter the amount of the deposit into the ATM, subject to manual verification when the envelope is removed from the machine by an operator. 
3.   A customer must be able to make a balance inquiry of any account linked to the card.

## Low Level Requirements
1. An ATM machine accepts a card from a user.
2. The user inputs a PIN to authenticate the userâ€™s identity.
3. The system validates the card and the PIN then either continues processing or rejects the card.
4. The ATM prompts the validated user for the type of transaction.

## Best method followed
- Used functions to decrease dependency on main function
- Used loops to exicute the commands one bye one and follow the flow.
- Printf statements have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions
- Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty

# Object Oriented Programming in Java

# Abstract:

Brick Breaker game consists of bricks aligned at the top of the screen. The player is represented as a tiny ball that is placed on a small platform at the bottom of the screen. The platform can be moved around from left to right on the screen with the help of arrow keys on the keyboard. The player uses the platform to keep the ball running. The goal is to break the bricks without missing the ball with your platform. The project makes use of Java swing, OOPS concepts and much more.

# State of art/ Research

This game is one of the classic platformer games, the game consists of a moving platform at the bottom of the screen that the player controls. The goal for the users is to try and destroy all the bricks on the top by bouncing a small ball of the plateform. Every brick the comes in contact with the ball gets destroyed.

I will be developing this application using Unreal 4 engine. The aim is create the game to run both on computers and mobile platforms. This will be a fun little game that can be played and enjoyed by all age groups.

# Primary and Secondary Features

## Primary Features
1. Single player
2. Player controlled moving platform
3. Bricks that can be destroyed
4. Moving Ball to destroy bricks
5. Be able to shot ball up on initial game start

## Secondary Features
1. Score counter
2. Number of balls remaining
3. Power ups add
4. Play sfx when ball hits/launches

# 4 W's and 1H
## Who
People to who need enjoy and have fun.

## When
when the people required to entertain there life .

## What
For makeing the people entertained.

## Where
Around any where the digital screan is present.

## How

# INTRODUCTION

Smart switches are designed as direct replacements for traditional built-in switches. Yes, you can still turn your lights on and off, just as you always did, but these smart switches provide you with much greater control over your home's lighting, as well as fans and hardwired appliances. A smart light switch replaces an existing light switch. When you link it to your home's wireless network you can flip that switch off and on remotely or via voice assistants. Your light bulbs don't need to be smart lights, they just need to be the lights connected to that switch.Smart Switch can transfer all your data, including your device settings, so that you can pick up your new device and carry on right where you left off. You can even create a backup for your old phone's files on your PC or Mac, then transfer or sync your data onto your new Galaxy phone.When you press buttons on smart light switches, they send wireless signals to control your smart lights (typically via WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee or Z-Wave) .


# FEATURES
- Smart switch enables us to control light,fan and fridge.
- MOOD LIGHTNING - Switch on lights (yellow,white,blue,red)based on your mood.
- Can controll your fan speed and turn it on or off.
- Can controll your fridge by adjusting temperature,turn on or off.
- encryption is available.
- Unique ID.
